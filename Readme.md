# What is this?

A laser cut and bent single piece bed concept, trying to implement a lightweight and stiff bed with full access to the mounting screws similar to the flatbed concept, but ditching the printed plastic parts

# Isnt't this expensive?

Lasercutting is surprisingly cheap - I got offers for manufacturing in small series for prices similar to the cast and machined bed which is mounted on top.

# Kiriwhat?
